"""The pixel harness against real Mol* output.

`test_pixels.py` proves the detectors work on images whose answer we set. This
proves they work on images Mol* produced, which is a different claim: a
harness can be perfectly correct about synthetic PNGs and still be pointed at
the wrong thing — the wrong canvas, a stale frame, an empty viewport — and
report a serene 0.0 forever.

The load-bearing test here is the hide/unhide pair. A coverage number on its
own is unfalsifiable; the same number taken with the molecule hidden and again
with it shown is what demonstrates the harness is reading the scene rather than
a constant. Every Phase 4 feature will lean on that pattern.

Requires a real browser and is opt-in:
